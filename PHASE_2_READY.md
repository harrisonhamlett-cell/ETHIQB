## 📈 Scalability

Your architecture is designed to scale:

### **1-100 Users**
- ✅ Free tier handles easily
- ✅ No code changes needed
- ✅ Performance excellent

### **100-1,000 Users**
- ✅ Still on free tier (database < 500MB)
- ✅ May need Vercel Pro for analytics
- ✅ No architecture changes needed

### **1,000-10,000 Users**
- ⚠️ Upgrade to Supabase Pro ($25/mo)
- ⚠️ Consider Vercel Pro ($20/mo)
- ✅ Architecture supports this scale
- ✅ Add caching for performance

### **10,000+ Users**
- ⚠️ Supabase Team plan ($599/mo) or higher
- ⚠️ Consider CDN for static assets
- ⚠️ Add Redis for session management
- ⚠️ Implement database read replicas

**Bottom line:** Your current architecture can handle **tens of thousands of users** without major rewrites.
